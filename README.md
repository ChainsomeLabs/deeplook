# DeepLook

This project provides a robust and efficient system for accessing **historical and real-time trading data** from the [DeepBook V3](https://github.com/MystenLabs/deepbookv3) decentralized orderbook on Sui. Built with a focus on performance, reliability, and observability, it delivers OHLCV data, live orderbooks, and trade-level summaries via a simple HTTP API.

---

## Features

- üìä **OHLCV Aggregation**  
  Aggregated candlestick data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) at 1-minute resolution using TimescaleDB.

- üßæ **Trade-Level Summaries**  
  Exposes normalized historical trades (excluding tick-by-tick) per pool with optional time filters.

- üìö **Historical Snapshots**  
  Live and historical orderbook snapshots per trading pair with timestamped updates.

- üß© **API Extensibility**  
  Fully compatible with all endpoints from `deepbookv3`, with custom endpoints added.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Monitoring and Metrics**  
  Includes a full observability stack:
  - [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for metrics
  - [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboards for visual monitoring

---

## Architecture

- **Backend Framework**: Built on top of `deepbookv3` fork.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB for high-performance time-series aggregation.
- **Deployment**: Dockerized services with NGINX reverse proxy and HTTPS enabled.
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus + Grafana with custom metrics for ingestion and uptime tracking.

## API Endpoints

All endpoints return JSON and are publicly accessible via HTTPS.

### `/get_pools`

Returns metadata for all available pools.  
[Example](https://api.sui.carmine.finance/get_pools)

### `/ohlcv/<pool_name>?start_time=<unix_sec>&end_time=<unix_sec>`

Returns OHLCV candlestick data for the specified time range.  
[Example](https://api.sui.carmine.finance/ohlcv/XBTC_USDC?start_time=1750370400&end_time=1750888800)

### `/orderbook/<pool_name>`

Returns the current orderbook snapshot and the timestamp of the last update.  
[Example](https://api.sui.carmine.finance/orderbook/SUI_USDC)

### `/ws_orderbook/<pool_name>`

Returns live orderbook via websocket that updates everytime a relevant event happens.  
[Example](wss://api.sui.carmine.finance/ws_orderbook/SUI_USDC)

### `/order_fills/<pool_name>?start_time=<unix_sec>&end_time=<unix_sec>`

Returns all trade-level order fills within the specified time window.  
[Example](https://api.sui.carmine.finance/order_fills/SUI_USDC?start_time=1750866244&end_time=1750886244)

---

## Aggregation Endpoints

Endpoints that aggregate data to provide further insights.

### `/aggregation/avg_trade_size/<pool_name>?start_time=<unix_sec>&end_time=<unix_sec>`

Returns the average base and quote volume per trade.  
[Example](https://api.sui.carmine.finance/get_avg_trade_size/SUI_USDC)

### `/aggregation/avg_duration_between_trades/<pool_name>?start_time=<unix_sec>&end_time=<unix_sec>`

Returns the average time in milliseconds between consecutive trades.  
[Example](https://api.sui.carmine.finance/get_avg_duration_between_trades/SUI_USDC)

### `/aggregation/vwap/<pool_name>?start_time=<unix_sec>&end_time=<unix_sec>`

Returns the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) over the selected time window.  
[Example](https://api.sui.carmine.finance/get_vwap/SUI_USDC?start_time=1750866244&end_time=1750886244)

### `/aggregation/orderbook_imbalance/<pool_name>?depth=<int>&level=<1|2>`

Returns the normalized order book imbalance (0‚Äì100 scale) at a given depth and level.  
[Example](https://api.sui.carmine.finance/orderbook_imbalance/SUI_USDC?depth=100&level=2)

---

## Live Orderbook

Onchian orderbook is fetched for each pool and then being updated with events that are live streamed.
The live orderbooks are stored in Redis for quick access and are served via websocket with live updates.
The websocket address is `wss://api.sui.carmine.finance/ws_orderbook/:pool_name`.

---

## Monitoring

- API and indexer prometheus metrics are gathered
- There is a Grafana dashboard for API and for indexer

Dashboards are available [here](http://deeplook.carmine.finance:3000/dashboards).

---

## Data Storage

- Aggregated OHLCV and trade data is stored in Postgresql with **TimescaleDB** extension for fast querying.

---

## Setup & Deployment

### Local development

The project has a Makefile that streamlines local development.

Create `.env` file for local development in the root directory with the following values:

```sh
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_DB=deeplook
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost/deeplook
REMOTE_STORE_URL=https://checkpoints.mainnet.sui.io
RPC_URL=https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443
ENV=mainnet
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

**Do not use these values in production**

Create Postgresql database locally using docker container.

```sh
make postgres
```

It is currently required to install Timescaledb manually. Access the container:

```sh
docker exec -it deeplook-db /bin/bash
```

And following [Install TimescaleDB on Linux tutorial](https://docs.tigerdata.com/self-hosted/latest/install/installation-linux/#install-timescaledb-on-linux).

Then create db with

```sh
make createdb
```

Run database migrations

```sh
make migrateup
```

Create Redis locally using docker container. Redis is used to hold live orderbook.

```sh
make redis
```

Run indexer (currently it runs from checkpoint 150000000 with `skip-watermark`, feel free to adjust this in the Makefile):

```sh
make indexer
```

Run API

```sh
make api
```

Run orderbook service that keeps track of orderbook events and updates live orderbook in Redis.

```sh
make orderbook
```

### Production

It is advised to build _docker images_ from `docker` folder and use those in production.

You need to have `postgresql` database with `timescaledb` extension, then provide ENV variables, specified above, with correct values and run the containers.
